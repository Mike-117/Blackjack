# Blackjack
 This is a game of blackjack that the user plays on a console. I created this to utilize a wide variety of C# principles and methods. 
 It is a console application in using the .NET Framework. The program consists of the gameplay itself, as well as the classes to be operated on. An algorithm is used to deal the cards, determine their value, decide the winner and calculate the earnings.
 
 There is a dealer, players, and a deck of cards to be dealt. The user gives their name and how much money they have. Then they are asked to bet. The cards are chosen randomly and dealt to each player accordingly. The user is shown their hand and asked to hit or stay. The dealer responds according to the fixed set of rules. The play continues until the player wins or loses. The earnings are tallied up, and a new hand is offered. This continues as long as the user wishes.
 
 The program accepts multiple inputs, handles exceptions, and allows the user to leave the game. It even checks for fraud.
